            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce I had the Honour of writing to your High and Mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses upon our departure from <hi>Torbay,</hi> we have used all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Endeavours to accomplish our Design; and coming about <hi>Heyssant,</hi> we sailed as near the <hi>French</hi> Coast as the Art of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation would permit. The Enemy upon our Coming near, raised the whole Country along the Coast, and made divers Shots at us a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> severall distances.</p>
            <p>We understanding from the Prisoners that we had taken in di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vers Barks, that a great part of the Gentry of <hi>Bretaign</hi> appeared a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:199152:3"/>
               <hi>Brest</hi> and thereabout, which City they had very much fortified, and furnished it with many Cannon; and that they had also placed others upon the Ships that were there ranged to prevent any coming into the Haven; all the Commanders of the Fleet were of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that (confidering how the Wind did bear, as also the Dangers of that Coast) we should doe no otherwise for the present, but shear off, and go with those ships upon which divers Companies of the Land-Forces were embarqued, and lie between <hi>Bell Isla</hi> and the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> till being all joyned together again, we should sail with our whole Force for the River <hi>Loyr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 23. of <hi>June</hi> we arrived before <hi>Bell Isle,</hi> and took the same day about the Evening 2 Barks laden with W<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne and Salt. The next day in the Morning we spake with a Skipper of an <hi>English</hi> Ship laden with Corn, that came out of the Haven from the Fort of <hi>Bell Isle,</hi> who assured us that he saw 8000 men in Arms in the Island, among which were 600 Horse, all Gentlemen, Inhabitants of the Continent. But this being not at all confirmed by a Pilot whom we had taken, and who was also upon <hi>Bell Isle</hi> 3 daies before, and told us that the same was but a Report, without any Certainty of Truth in it; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we resolved to land upon this Island, and I went with the Heer Admirall <hi>Tromp</hi> to take a View thereof, and found a very convenient <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lace for Landing.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I sent a Trumpeter to the Inhabitants, with an Order that they should depute some to come on B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>der, returned the same presently again into his hand, and said, <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>at the Inhabitants should not submit to that Order; and if so be <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e would attack the Island, that they should very well be able to <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>fend the same.</p>
            <p>Hereupon we landed very happily the next day in the Morning, <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ding much less Resistence then we expected, not withstanding the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nemy had made 2 Retrenchments there, one above another, that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere thick set with men. The climbing up the Hill was found to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> very tedious. So far as I can judge, and as I verily believe, there <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere not in all above 3000 men upon the Island that were in Arms: that <hi>English</hi>-man was much mistaken.</p>
            <p>This Evening after we had traversed one part of the Island, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:199152:3"/>in a Valley, about a Musket-Shot from the Castle, where we found water to drink, a convenience very much wanting in that Island.</p>
            <p>The 28<seg rend="sup">th</seg>^ of <hi>June</hi> we encamped at <hi>Soison,</hi> where we brought together the most part of the Cattel that were upon that Island, whereof there was great store, and put them on board the Fleet.</p>
            <p>After we had layn there 2 days, getting a sight of our foremost Ships, we resolved to embark again, without making any Attempt upon the Fort; for it would have taken up too much time, which we might otherwise employ more profitably and advantageously in the Service of your High and Mightinesses. We took also 3 Pieces of Canon with us, which we had taken from the Enemy. We stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our Course to the River of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and came upon the 3<seg rend="sup">d</seg>. of <hi>July</hi> in the Morning into the Bay of <hi>Bourg-neuf,</hi> and anchored over against <hi>Nermontier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Tide being spent that day before we could land, we resolved the next day to make up to the Island of <hi>Nermontier,</hi> which we did. The Enemy had there upon the Coast cast up some Batteries and Trenches, in which they had posted their Muskettiers: and because there was not much water, so that we could not come to Land with our Sloops, Boats &amp; Pinks, the most of our men marched up to the Middle through the water, so that divers of their Bandeliers were spoiled.</p>
            <p>The Enemy made some Discharges upon us out of their Trenches, and from behind the Walls of a Dorp, under which in a short space after we landed. We were no sooner come among them, but they betook themselves to flight, and saved themselves upon the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of <hi>Poictou;</hi> quitting also at the same time the Castle of <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We took upon the same, as also upon the Batteries along the Coast, 17 Great Pieces, 8 of Brass, and 9 of Iron, with 19 Ships that were on ground, and could not be carried away. In the Service we had 135 killed and wounded, with divers Officers; as namely, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Colonel and Major of my Regiment, 1 Captain, 1 Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Lieutenant, and 2 Ensigns, who in all probability will be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
            <p>The Prisoners that we took in the Rencounter told us, that there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:199152:4"/>were 5000 men upon the Continent ready to come for the Island, and that there were 500 already on their march towards it: which made me to hasten my March as much as might be, to encounter them upon the Passage, leaving Captain <hi>Braekell</hi> with 3 Companies of S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>amen, and 70 Muskettiers, to defend the Castle; and Captain <hi>Hardenbroeck,</hi> with a Company of Seamen of Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi>'s, in the Abby. Coming in the Evening near the Passage, we understood that they were all retired again to the Continent, where we also could discern a great Number of people, as well Foot as Horse. The want of fresh water obliged me to encamp one hour's distance from thenc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, leaving the Heer <hi>van Somerdijck</hi> with 400 men for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that Post.</p>
            <p>The 5<seg rend="sup">th</seg>. of <hi>July</hi> in the Morning came thereabout 2 Brigandines built after the fashion of Gallies, which those of <hi>Rochel</hi> had sent to discover our Fleet, each of them having on board 3 Pieces of Canon and 35 Seamen, all well armed. These not knowing that we were landed, came near the Shoar, where the Heer <hi>van Somerdijk</hi> had laid 60 Muskettiers close behind a Hillock; and while he amused them by leaving one <hi>French</hi>-man for them to see, the rest came so suddenly up to them, that they surrendred themselves.</p>
            <p>It is conjectured this Island hath about 2000 Houses in it; and it is divided for near 50 Rods from the main Continent, so that we could shoot with our Muskets easily to the Enemy that lay encamped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us on the other side of the Water, and they to us. At Low-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Land that lies between <hi>Bovin</hi> and <hi>Beauvoir,</hi> which is the firm Land of <hi>Poictou,</hi> puts out so far, and this Island is so dry, that they could pass over dry shod with as many men in Front as they pleased, from the one side to the other; which Passage is but an hour's going, and may be marched either 2 hours before, or 2 hours after Low-water.</p>
            <p>The Enemy gave out a report, as if they had Orders from the King to come over with all their Forces, as well Foot as Horse, to make us quit that Post: in the mean time they themselves set all their Salt-pans on fire about <hi>Bovin</hi> and <hi>Beauvoir,</hi> by which we discovered, that they were more afraid of our coming over to them, then that they had any intention to attack us.</p>
            <p>After we had lain there 3 weeks, your High and Mightinesses Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice forbidding my proceeding any farther there, we imbarked again,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:199152:4"/>having first blown up a part of he Castle, sl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ghted their Works along the Coast, levelled their Houses, all their Cattel (which were a great Number) being consumed; and moreover having taken Hostages of them, till the money should be paid which was agreed upon for the saving their Houses from Burning, being the summe of 14000 Rix-dollers: which Agreement hath been since advanced by their R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tariness.</p>
            <p>From our Prisoners we understand, that the Duke <hi>de Chaulnes</hi> is with a Reserve of 40 0 Horse of the Gentry between <hi>Croisic</hi> and <hi>St. Lazare,</hi> about 6 hours march from thence; and that the Duke <hi>de Retz,</hi> with about 1200 Gentlemen, and 5000 of the Inhabitants, was between <hi>Bourg-neuf</hi> and <hi>Mache,</hi> one hour from thence. The Duke <hi>de Vieuville,</hi> with 2000 Gentlemen, all Horse, and 8000 Inhabitants, were spread over against us in our sight, at <hi>Bovin</hi> and <hi>Beauvoir:</hi> The 2 last may joyn at a short warning.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guadagne</hi> commands at <hi>Rochel, Oleron,</hi> and the Isle of <hi>Rhé</hi> into which places they have put most of the Souldiery, supposing that our Design may lie there.</p>
            <p>According to the report of divers Prisoners, which is also confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hamburgers</hi> Ships coming from thence, there are in the Island of <hi>Rhé</hi> onely, 10000 men in Arms, and 1000 Horse: they have also drawn amongst them 5000 of the Inhabitants, and within this 6 weeks there are come to them the Foot-Regiments of <hi>Guadagne, Neuf-ville, Louvigny,</hi> and a Battalion of Marine Foot, with other particular Companies, as also the Horse-Regiments of <hi>Courselle</hi> and <hi>Belleguard:</hi> the first of which hath a Command under <hi>Guadagne;</hi> the second over the Horse; and <hi>Lauvay</hi> over the Fortifications.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Oleron</hi> we have no farther particulars, but that they are full of Souldiers there, as well Foot as Horse; and that within this 3 weeks there is also arrived a Battalion of the Marine Companies.</p>
            <p>The Governour of <hi>St. Sebastian</hi> hath written to me, that he had made a narrow Enquiry into the Forces of the Enemy along the Coasts, and found that they had in Arms above 80000 Foot and 6000 Horse, f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The Prisoners, and others that are come from thence, say that the Misery along the Coast is so great, that they are wholly ruined by the

            <p>The Heer Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> hath given your High and Mightinesses Advice of the Burning of a <hi>French</hi> Fregat, which was chased on the Coast by 2 of our Men of War, with his taking of a good Prize; so that I will not here repeat the same. We shall be presently again under sail, to prosecute what farther Work is appointed us.</p>
